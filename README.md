Welcome to KDD 2023 Entertainment, Sports and Media Day

KDD Special Days are satellite events co-hosted with the main conference with special emerging topics that are appealing to the KDD community. They are either half-day or one-day events with the forms of invited speakers, panel discussions, and demos, with the goal to discuss the trends, identify challenges, and provide visionary insights and solutions.

As KDD 2023 comes to the home of Hollywood, we are pleased to announce the special day on Entertainment, Sports and Media (ESM) Day. It will be a full day event where we will bring together leading researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry in the field of ESM. The topic of interests includes but not limited to:

* New technologies and applications of machine learning and data mining in entertainment, sports, and media
* Innovative approaches to engaging audiences and consumers such as conversational AI.
* New models for monetizing content and experiences
* Emerging trends and opportunities from big techs, start-ups and VCs in these industries
* Social and cultural impact of entertainment, sports, and media with the rise of streaming platforms and online services.

| 8:05 - 8:30 | Kickoff | Exciting opportunities for AI in Sports, Media and Entertainment | Special Day Chairs | -- |
| 8:30 - 9:10 | Sports|	Next way of seeing sports	|  [Tracey Ho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/traceych/),	VP of AI Products at Second Spectrum	|  Artificial Intelligence, in particular Machine Learning and Computer Vision, are transforming sports.  In this talk, we give an inside look at new technologies and capabilities that sports teams, leagues, broadcasters and other partners are leveraging to fundamentally change many aspects of sports, from team analytics to personalized fan experiences, in places like the NBA, NFL and English Premier League. | 
| 9:10 - 9:50 | Media	|Data science @ the New york Times	| [Chris H. Wiggins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wiggins/),	Chief Data Scientist, New York Times	| The Data Science group at The New York Times develops and deploys machine learning solutions to newsroom and business problems. Re-framing real-world questions as machine learning tasks requires not only adapting and extending models and algorithms to new or special cases but also sufficient breadth to know the right method for the right challenge. I'll first outline how unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning methods are increasingly used in human applications for description, prediction, and prescription, espectively. I'll then focus on the 'prescriptive' cases, showing how methods from the reinforcement learning and causal inference literatures can be of direct impact in engineering, business, and decision-making more generally. | 
| 10:00 - 10:40 | Entertainment |	TBD | [Adam Hussein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahusein/)	SVP, Global Data Science & Analytics, Warner Bros| --- | 
| 10:40 - 11:20 | Entertainment |	The Science & Art Of Producing Entertainment	| [Rikwik Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritwik-kumar/),	Senior Director, Machine Learning at Netflix	| Netflix plans to spend about $17 billion over the next year on content. Creators of these stories pour their hearts and souls into turning ideas into joy for Netflix viewers. The sublime art of doing this well is hard to describe, but it necessitates carefully orchestrating creative, business, and technical decisions. In this talk, I will explore how one can use data analytics, machine learning, and AI to enhance creativity and support better decisions that ultimately enable amazing storytelling. | 

#### Panel Discussion: AI Opportunities in Sports, Media and Entertainment
##### Time:  11:30 - 12:15
##### Panelist: 
* Karin Kricorian	Disney			VP Decision Science, Disney
* Tracey Ho	Second Spectrum			VP of AI Products at Second Spectrum
* Adam Hussein	Warner Bros			SVP, Global Data Science & Analytics

### Workshop on Data Science and AI for Sports (stay tuned) 
We are excited to announce that the ESM Day is joining force with [KDD 2023 Workshop on Data Science and AI for Sports (DSAI4Sports)](https://dsai4sports.github.io/). The DSAI4Sports workshop aims to bring together interested researchers and practitioners at the intersection of AI/ML and sports analytics. We will offer a platform to exchange research ideas, identify research opportunities and challenges in applying AI/ML for sports analytics, engage in thoughtful discussions, and foster the development of a research community centered around this field. Both the ESM Day and the DSAI4Sports workshop will take place on the same day (Aug 7th) and in same conference room (details to come).
