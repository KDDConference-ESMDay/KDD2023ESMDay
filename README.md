Welcome to KDD 2023 Entertainment, Sports and Media Day

KDD Special Days are satellite events co-hosted with the main conference with special emerging topics that are appealing to the KDD community. They are either half-day or one-day events with the forms of invited speakers, panel discussions, and demos, with the goal to discuss the trends, identify challenges, and provide visionary insights and solutions.

As KDD 2023 comes to the home of Hollywood, we are pleased to announce the special day on Entertainment, Sports and Media (ESM) Day. It will be a full day event where we will bring together leading researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry in the field of ESM. The topic of interests includes but not limited to:

* New technologies and applications of machine learning and data mining in entertainment, sports, and media
* Innovative approaches to engaging audiences and consumers such as conversational AI.
* New models for monetizing content and experiences
* Emerging trends and opportunities from big techs, start-ups and VCs in these industries
* Social and cultural impact of entertainment, sports, and media with the rise of streaming platforms and online services.

We are excited to announce that the ESM Day is joining force with [KDD 2023 Workshop on Data Science and AI for Sports (DSAI4Sports)](https://dsai4sports.github.io/). The DSAI4Sports workshop aims to bring together interested researchers and practitioners at the intersection of AI/ML and sports analytics. We will offer a platform to exchange research ideas, identify research opportunities and challenges in applying AI/ML for sports analytics, engage in thoughtful discussions, and foster the development of a research community centered around this field. Both the ESM Day and the DSAI4Sports workshop will take place on the same day (Aug 7th) and in same conference room (details to come).
