### Learn more about each keynote
> **The Secrets of the Data Science Behind Hollywood's Magic**

Learn about the Data Science that goes into making your favorite Movies and TV shows in "The Secrets of the Data Science Behind Hollywood's Magic." This talk offers a captivating dive into the intertwining worlds of data science and entertainment. Through personal experiences, innovative case studies, and invaluable insights, Adam unveils how data science, analytics, and AI shape the stories that enchant us. This talk will take you behind the scenes to show you groundbreaking analytics tools revolutionizing content creation, and provide a rare glimpse into the data-driven core of the entertainment industry. Attendees will walk away with practical knowledge and best practices that are as applicable in Hollywood as they are in any industry.

> **Next way of seeing sports**  

Artificial Intelligence, in particular Machine Learning and Computer Vision, are transforming sports.  In this talk, we give an inside look at new technologies and capabilities that sports teams, leagues, broadcasters and other partners are leveraging to fundamentally change many aspects of sports, from team analytics to personalized fan experiences, in places like the NBA, NFL and English Premier League.

> **Data science @ the New York Times**  

The Data Science group at The New York Times develops and deploys machine learning solutions to newsroom and business problems. Re-framing real-world questions as machine learning tasks requires not only adapting and extending models and algorithms to new or special cases but also sufficient breadth to know the right method for the right challenge. I'll first outline how unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning methods are increasingly used in human applications for description, prediction, and prescription, espectively. I'll then focus on the 'prescriptive' cases, showing how methods from the reinforcement learning and causal inference literatures can be of direct impact in engineering, business, and decision-making more generally.

> **Next Gen Stats @ NFL**

Since its inception in 2016, the NFL's Next Gen Stats group has revolutionized football statistics. Through the utilization of player tracking data, NGS has developed a series of innovative metrics, many of which powered by distinct machine learning models. Each model delves into a unique facet of the game, contributing to comprehensive metrics that can evaluate the performance of not only individual players but entire teams and beyond. From Completion Probability to Expected Rushing Yards and the intuitive Fourth Down Decision Guide, I'll guide you on a fascinating journey through the many machine learning models in production at Next Gen Stats.

> **When Data Meets Reality Augmenting Sports Scenes with Visualizations**
 
Augmented sports videos have become increasingly popular among sports enthusiasts worldwide. They combine embedded visualizations and video effects to present data overlaid on videos to effectively communicate sports insights. However, creating these videos can be challenging, requiring significant time and video editing skills. In this talk, I will present a set of human-AI systems that ease visualizing data into sports video to enhance data-experiences for sports games.  These systems enable natural interactions, such as using natural language or gaze, to interact with in-game data, catering to experts, general audiences, and fans alike. I will share ongoing research endeavors aimed at creating a more immersive, interactive, and enjoyable game-watching experience for the future.

> **Moments**

Moments are what define fandom. FOX believes in harnessing the power of the data and ML/AI to contextualize these moments to offer up new and exciting experiences that revolutionize fandom. In this talk, Phil will share how FOX leverages data to create products that attract and retain viewers, while redefining personalization and hyper-engaging fans.
