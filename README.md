### Learn more about each keynote
> **The Secrets of the Data Science Behind Hollywood's Magic**

Learn about the Data Science that goes into making your favorite Movies and TV shows in "The Secrets of the Data Science Behind Hollywood's Magic." This talk offers a captivating dive into the intertwining worlds of data science and entertainment. Through personal experiences, innovative case studies, and invaluable insights, Adam unveils how data science, analytics, and AI shape the stories that enchant us. This talk will take you behind the scenes to show you groundbreaking analytics tools revolutionizing content creation, and provide a rare glimpse into the data-driven core of the entertainment industry. Attendees will walk away with practical knowledge and best practices that are as applicable in Hollywood as they are in any industry.

> **Next way of seeing sports**  

Artificial Intelligence, in particular Machine Learning and Computer Vision, are transforming sports.  In this talk, we give an inside look at new technologies and capabilities that sports teams, leagues, broadcasters and other partners are leveraging to fundamentally change many aspects of sports, from team analytics to personalized fan experiences, in places like the NBA, NFL and English Premier League.

> **Data science @ the New york Times**  

The Data Science group at The New York Times develops and deploys machine learning solutions to newsroom and business problems. Re-framing real-world questions as machine learning tasks requires not only adapting and extending models and algorithms to new or special cases but also sufficient breadth to know the right method for the right challenge. I'll first outline how unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning methods are increasingly used in human applications for description, prediction, and prescription, espectively. I'll then focus on the 'prescriptive' cases, showing how methods from the reinforcement learning and causal inference literatures can be of direct impact in engineering, business, and decision-making more generally.

> **The Science & Art Of Producing Entertainment**  

Netflix plans to spend about $17 billion over the next year on content. Creators of these stories pour their hearts and souls into turning ideas into joy for Netflix viewers. The sublime art of doing this well is hard to describe, but it necessitates carefully orchestrating creative, business, and technical decisions. In this talk, I will explore how one can use data analytics, machine learning, and AI to enhance creativity and support better decisions that ultimately enable amazing storytelling.

> **When Data Meets Reality Augmenting Sports Scenes with Visualizations**
 
Zhutian will will introduce our latest research in using AR/VR visualization techniques to enhance the experience of sports analysts, audiences, and fans.
